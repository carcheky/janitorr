# Copilot Instructions Setup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the GitHub Copilot instructions setup for the Janitorr repository, following best practices from [GitHub's Copilot coding agent tips](https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips).

## What Was Added

The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file has been enhanced with the following sections:

### 1. Quick Reference Section (NEW)
**Location**: Top of file  
**Purpose**: Provide instant access to most commonly used commands and paths

**Includes**:
- Common Gradle commands (build, test, run, Docker)
- Key directory locations
- Commit message format reminder

### 2. Commit Message Conventions (NEW)
**Location**: After "Additional Resources" section  
**Purpose**: Ensure all contributors follow Conventional Commits specification

**Includes**:
- Detailed commit format explanation
- Valid commit types with version impact
- Breaking change syntax
- Multiple examples
- Reference to CONTRIBUTING.md

**Why**: The project uses semantic-release which depends on proper commit messages. This section helps Copilot suggest correctly formatted commits.

### 3. Common Development Tasks (NEW)
**Location**: After "Commit Message Conventions"  
**Purpose**: Provide step-by-step guides for frequent development workflows

**Includes**:
- Adding a new feature (with bilingual doc reminder)
- Fixing a bug
- Updating documentation
- Testing Docker image changes

**Why**: These workflows appear frequently in the repository. Having them documented helps Copilot provide better guidance for common tasks.

### 4. CI/CD Integration (NEW)
**Location**: After "Common Development Tasks"  
**Purpose**: Explain automated workflows and release process

**Includes**:
- Description of all GitHub Actions workflows
- Release strategy (main vs develop branches)
- Docker image tagging conventions
- Version bump rules

**Why**: Understanding the CI/CD pipeline helps Copilot suggest changes that work with the automated release process.

### 5. Debugging and Troubleshooting (NEW)
**Location**: After "Common Pitfalls to Avoid"  
**Purpose**: Help debug common issues during development

**Includes**:
- Debug mode commands
- Common build issues and solutions
- Debugging cleanup logic examples
- Container debugging commands

**Why**: These are frequently encountered issues. Having solutions readily available helps Copilot provide better troubleshooting assistance.

### 6. Enhanced "When Unsure" Section (UPDATED)
**Location**: End of file  
**Purpose**: Updated with additional guidance

**Added**:
- Ensure commit messages follow conventional format
- Check if changes affect both JVM and native image builds

## Best Practices Followed

✅ **File Location**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (correct location)  
✅ **Project Overview**: Comprehensive description of what Janitorr does  
✅ **Build Commands**: Clear, tested build and test commands  
✅ **Code Style**: Kotlin conventions and Spring Boot patterns  
✅ **Project Structure**: Directory layout with explanations  
✅ **Common Pitfalls**: Warnings about dry-run mode, paths, bilingual docs  
✅ **Examples**: Practical code examples and common workflows  
✅ **CI/CD Integration**: Explanation of automated workflows  
✅ **Quick Reference**: Fast access to most-used information  

## Key Improvements

### For Developers
1. **Faster Onboarding**: New contributors can quickly understand the project
2. **Correct Commits**: Clear guidance on commit message format
3. **Common Tasks**: Step-by-step guides for frequent workflows
4. **Debug Help**: Solutions to common issues

### For Copilot
1. **Better Code Suggestions**: Understands project conventions
2. **Correct Commit Messages**: Can suggest properly formatted commits
3. **Workflow Awareness**: Knows about CI/CD and release process
4. **Context-Aware**: Understands bilingual documentation requirement

## File Statistics

- **Original Lines**: 227
- **New Lines**: 433
- **Lines Added**: 207
- **Sections Added**: 5 new sections
- **Sections Updated**: 1 section enhanced

## Validation

✅ File is properly formatted Markdown  
✅ All code blocks are properly fenced  
✅ All internal links use correct anchors  
✅ All sections are logically organized  
✅ Examples use correct project paths  
✅ Commands match actual project setup  

## Next Steps

The Copilot instructions are now set up according to best practices. Future updates should:

1. Keep the file up-to-date with project changes
2. Add new sections as patterns emerge
3. Update examples when APIs change
4. Maintain consistency with CONTRIBUTING.md
