## What is Janitorr?

**Janitorr** manages your media and cleans up after you.

- Do you hate being the janitor of your server?
- Do you have a lot of media that never gets watched?
- Do your users constantly request media, and let it sit there afterward never to be touched again?

Then you need Janitorr for Jellyfin and Emby. It's THE solution for cleaning up your server and freeing up space before you run into issues.
