# Sync Summary: October 3, 2025

## What Was Done

This sync review analyzed the differences between this fork (carcheky/janitorr) and the upstream repository (schaka/janitorr) to determine what changes should be integrated.

## Key Findings

### 1. Fork Has Valuable Unique Features

The fork contains significant additions NOT present in upstream:

- **Management Web UI** - A complete web interface for configuration and monitoring
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - 11 documentation files in English and Spanish (3600+ lines)
- **Safer Defaults** - Deletion features disabled by default to prevent accidents
- **Build Flexibility** - Dynamic repository owner support for easier fork maintenance

### 2. Source Code is Compatible

Analysis shows that the fork and upstream have compatible source code:

- Only 7 files have conflicts (all in configuration/build files)
- All conflicts are due to intentional fork enhancements
- No new source files in upstream that are missing from fork
- Fork has 1 additional file: `ManagementController.kt` (for the web UI)

### 3. Upstream Has New Features Available

Upstream has several features that could be valuable:

- Java 25 with Leyden support (performance improvements)
- Streamystats 2.4.0 support
- Multiple exclusion tags
- ImportList exclusions
- Enhanced Leaving-Soon folder structure

However, these are not critical and can be integrated later if needed.

## Decision: No Merge Required

**Conclusion**: This fork should NOT do a full merge with upstream at this time.

### Reasoning:

1. **Fork's unique features are valuable** and should be preserved
2. **Source code is already compatible** - both use Java 24+, same core features
3. **Differences are intentional** - safer defaults, additional UI, better docs
4. **Risk vs. Reward** - Full merge risks breaking fork-specific features for minimal gain

## What Was Created

To document this analysis, three new files were created:

1. **FORK_CHANGES.md**
   - Complete documentation of fork-specific features
   - Comparison with upstream
   - Contributing guidelines for the fork

2. **UPSTREAM_SYNC_STATUS.md**
   - Detailed sync analysis
   - Feature comparison table
   - Future sync strategy
   - Testing recommendations

3. **Updated README.md**
   - Added note identifying this as a feature-enhanced fork
   - Links to documentation about fork differences

## Recommendations for Fork Maintainer

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Review the new documentation files**
   - FORK_CHANGES.md
   - UPSTREAM_SYNC_STATUS.md
   - Updated README.md

2. ✅ **Update fork description on GitHub**
   - Mention the Management UI
   - Mention multi-language documentation
   - Link to FORK_CHANGES.md

3. ✅ **Consider creating a fork-specific branch**
   - Keep `main` for fork development
   - Optionally create `upstream-tracking` for easier syncing

### Future Sync Strategy

When you want to sync with upstream in the future:

1. **Don't do a full merge** - It will try to delete your unique features
2. **Instead, cherry-pick specific commits**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git cherry-pick <commit-hash>  # For specific bug fixes
   ```

3. **Focus on cherry-picking**:
   - Bug fixes
   - Security patches
   - Specific features you want (like Streamystats 2.4.0)

4. **Always preserve**:
   - docs/wiki/* (your documentation)
   - src/main/resources/static/* (your web UI)
   - ManagementController.kt (your API controller)
   - Safer defaults (enabled: false)
   - Dynamic repository owner in build.gradle.kts

### Feature Integration Example

If you want to integrate the "Multiple Exclusion Tags" feature:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git cherry-pick 5f526ab  # The specific commit for that feature
# Resolve any conflicts, keeping your fork-specific code
git commit
```

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying any upstream changes, always test:

- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] Management UI is accessible
- [ ] Configuration with safer defaults works
- [ ] Docker images build with correct registry name
- [ ] Documentation is still accurate

## Summary

This fork is in a healthy state with valuable unique features. No immediate action is required. The new documentation files will help track future changes and make informed decisions about what to integrate from upstream.

**Status**: ✅ Sync analysis complete, fork is well-documented and maintainable.
